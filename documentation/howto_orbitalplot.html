<h1>How to do orbital plots with <em>ParaGauss</em> and <em>ParaPlot</em></h1>
In order to generate orbital plots, you have to perform three steps. 
<ol>
<li> First, a file containing the MO coefficients <b>saved_eigenvec.dat</b> has
to be generated with a full <em>ParaGauss</em> run. It is important, that the file is
created with the <tt>save_eigenvec</tt> and <tt>save_eigenvec_all</tt> switches.
Please refer to the <a href="file:/home/ttfs/DOCUMENTATION/users_manual.html#namelist_RECOVER_OPTIONS"> RECOVER_OPTIONS </a>.
Note that once you have the file <b>saved_eigenvec.dat</b> you can use this for
plots of any orbital of the system under investigation. <br>

<li> With the file <b>saved_eigenvec.dat</b> in your input-directory, a so-called 
<a href="file:/home/ttfs/DOCUMENTATION/users_manual.html#namelist_PROPERTIES"> properties-run </a> 
 has to be done in order to generate a data-file <b> plot.dat</b>
plot program <em>ParaPlot</em>. This is a run in which only the symmetry part and a
short integral part of <em>ParaGauss</em> is performed. <br>Usually this will take only some
minutes and you will not have to run this in parallel or submit it to a queue
unless you are dealing with a really large molecule. Please be aware that the 
parallel version may still be somewhat contaminated with bugs. A serial run,
however, should represent no problem.<br>
In order to specify the plane of the plot, the orbitals to be displayed and so on, 
please look up the namelist <a href="file:/home/ttfs/DOCUMENTATION/users_manual.html#namelist_ORBITAL_PLOT">
orbital_plot </a>. You may have to play around with this a bit until you
find the optimal geometrical parameters and thus please remember to keep
the file <b>saved_eigenvec.dat</b>.
<li> Finally, the actual plot program <a href="file:/home/ttfs/DOCUMENTATION/DOK/paraplot.dvi"> <em>ParaPlot</em> </a> 
has to be called. Note, that although the file <b>plot.dat</b> may contain data sets for 
several orbitals, you do not have to plot them all. Instead, you may specify those which
you want to appear in one plot in the input file <b>orb_plot.input</b> for <em>ParaPlot</em>.
