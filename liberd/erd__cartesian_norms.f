C  OPERATION   : ERD__CARTESIAN_NORMS
C  MODULE      : ELECTRON REPULSION INTEGRALS DIRECT
C  MODULE-ID   : ERD
C  SUBROUTINES : none
C  DESCRIPTION : This operation generates all partial cartesian
C                normalization factors. The cartesian normalization
C                factors are xyz-exponent dependent and are given for
C                a specific monomial as:
C
C                                    ______________________
C                     l m n         /       2^(2L)
C                    x y z -->     / -----------------------
C                                \/ (2l-1)!!(2m-1)!!(2n-1)!!
C
C
C                where L = l+m+n. The best way to deal with these
C                factors for a complete set of monomials for fixed L
C                is to split up each factor into its l-,m- and n-
C                component:
C
C                       _______        _______        _______
C                      / 2^(2l)       / 2^(2m)       / 2^(2n)
C                     / -------  *   / -------  *   / -------
C                   \/ (2l-1)!!    \/ (2m-1)!!    \/ (2n-1)!!
C
C
C                and to precalculate each possible partial factor
C                only once for the range l = 0,1,...,L, where L denotes
C                the maximum shell quantum number that can possibly
C                arise during integral evaluation.
C
C                Note, that the first two factors for l = 0 and 1
C                are equal to 1 and 2 and in fact these are the only
C                ones that are needed for s- and p-functions.
C
C
C                  Input:
C
C                       L         =  maximum shell quantum number
C
C                  Output:
C
C                       NORM (I)  =  cartesian norms from I=0,1,...,L
