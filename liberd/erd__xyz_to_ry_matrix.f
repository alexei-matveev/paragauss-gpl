C  SUBROUTINES : none
C  DESCRIPTION : This operation generates the transformation matrix for
C                performing a primitive gaussian integral batch
C                transformation from cartesian to spherical gaussian
C                type orbitals.
C
C                Input:
C
C                     NXYZ = dimension of xyz-monomial basis
C                            corresponding to the specified shell
C                            quantum number L.
C                            Must at least be equal to (L+1)*(L+2)/2.
C
C                      NRY = dimension of ry-spherical basis
C                            corresponding to the specified shell
C                            quantum number L.
C                            Must at least be equal to 2L+1.
C
C                   NROWMX = maximum number of xyz-monomials in one
C                            ry-solid harmonic function corresponding
C                            to the specified shell quantum number L.
C                            Must at least be equal to (L/2+1)*(L/2+2)/2.
C
C                        L = Shell quantum number.
C
C                     TEMP = temporary scratch array.
C
C
C                Output:
C
C                     NROW (I) = Number of xyz-monomials contributing
C                                to the I-th ry-component.
C
C                    ROW (K,I) = K-th xyz-monomial position number
C                                containing nonzero contribution to
C                                the I-th ry-component.
C
C                   TMAT (K,I) = K-th nonzero xyz-monomial coefficient
C                                to the I-th ry-component.
C
C
C                Each ry-component for a specific shell type corresponds
C                to a sherical harmonic function Y (L,M) with M ranging
C                from -L to +L. The TMAT matrix ry-component indices are
C                ordered such that +L corresponds to the 1st index and
C                -L to the last one.
C
C                For the ordering of the xyz-monomials used in the
C                expansion of the ry-components we use the usual
C                preference ordering p>q>r in the x-,y- and z-exponents
C                of x^p y^q z^r. For L=3 we would thus have the 10
C                monomials arranged as follows:
C
C                                #  |  x  y  z
C                              -----------------
C                                1  |  3  0  0
C                                2  |  2  1  0
C                                3  |  2  0  1
C                                4  |  1  2  0
C                                5  |  1  1  1
C                                6  |  1  0  2
C                                7  |  0  3  0
C                                8  |  0  2  1
C                                9  |  0  1  2
C                               10  |  0  0  3
C
C                This ordering is also assumed when evaluating batches
C                of cartesian gaussian integrals, hence the present
C                routine and the cartesian gaussian integral generation
C                routines go hand in hand and must be viewed together
C                when performing xyz-monomial basis ordering changes!
C
C                The ultimate goal of using the present routine is
C                to achieve achieve a transformation matrix T relating
C                cartesian gaussian functions to spherical ones.
C                At his stage it is convenient to introduce all
C                factors independent! of the gaussian exponents that
C                enter the final normalization constant for each
C                spherical gaussian function. Such a function is given
C                by the following expression:
C
C                    LM                     L    LM                2
C                 GTO  (r,t,p) = N (L,a) * r  * Y  (t,p) * exp (-ar )
C                    a
C
C                where t = theta and p = phi and N (L,a) denotes a
C                normalization factor such that
C
C                              LM       *    LM
C                 integral {GTO  (r,t,p)  GTO  (r,t,p) dr dt dp} = 1
C                              a             a
C
C                Since the spherical harmonics are normalized, we can
C                integrate out over the angles t and p and arrive at
C                the following defining expression for N (L,a):
C
C                        2  r=oo  2L+2          2
C                 N (L,a)   int  r     exp (-2ar ) dr  =  1
C                           r=0
C
C                which leads to:
C
C                               ____________________________
C                              / 2^(2L+3+1/2) * a^((2L+3)/2)
C                 N (L,a) =   / -----------------------------
C                           \/     (2L+1)!! * sqrt (pi)
C
C
C                The following part of N (L,a) has already been
C                taken care of during the cartesian integrals
C                generation:
C
C                               ____________________________
C                              / 2^(1+1/2) * a^((2L+3)/2)
C                 N (L,a) =   / -----------------------------
C                           \/          sqrt (pi)
C
C
C                hence we are left only with the following part
C                of N (L,a) to deal with here:
C
C                                   __________
C                                  / 2^(2L+2)
C                                 / -----------
C                               \/   (2L+1)!!
C
C                which is designated RNORM (to reflect its origin)
C                and is being calculated in logarithmic form to avoid
C                integer overflow for the double factorial. The
C                normalization constant for the spherical harmonic
C                part, depending on both L and M quantum numbers,
C                is designated YNORM and is evaluated stepwise
C                from its base value at M = -L or L downwards to
C                -1 or 0. Note, that YNORM should also include a factor
C                in terms of pi, namely 1/sqrt(pi), but this has also
C                already been incorporated into the cartesian integrals
C                evaluation routine.

C
C                There are two ways of coding this:
C
C                    1) symbolically, in which the nominators and
C                       denominators of all fractions are handled
C                       separately, performing common divisor cuts
C                       at every single step. This procedure is
C                       slower than the direct evaluation but more
C                       accurate. Also the symbollic procedure suffers
C                       from integer overflow at about L = 16, so
C                       there is a limit on the shell size one can
C                       safely handle.
C
C                    2) the direct mode, in which all fractions are
C                       multiplied together as flp's.
C
C                This routine uses the direct mode.
