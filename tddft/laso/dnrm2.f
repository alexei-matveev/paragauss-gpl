C
C     FOUR PHASE METHOD     USING TWO BUILT-IN CONSTANTS THAT ARE
C     HOPEFULLY APPLICABLE TO ALL MACHINES.
C         CUTLO = MAXIMUM OF  DSQRT(U/EPS)  OVER ALL KNOWN MACHINES.
C         CUTHI = MINIMUM OF  DSQRT(V)      OVER ALL KNOWN MACHINES.
C     WHERE
C         EPS = SMALLEST NO. SUCH THAT EPS + 1. .GT. 1.
C         U   = SMALLEST POSITIVE NO.   (UNDERFLOW LIMIT)
C         V   = LARGEST  NO.            (OVERFLOW  LIMIT)

C     BRIEF OUTLINE OF ALGORITHM..
C
C     PHASE 1    SCANS ZERO COMPONENTS.
C     MOVE TO PHASE 2 WHEN A COMPONENT IS NONZERO AND .LE. CUTLO
C     MOVE TO PHASE 3 WHEN A COMPONENT IS .GT. CUTLO
C     MOVE TO PHASE 4 WHEN A COMPONENT IS .GE. CUTHI/M
C     WHERE M = N FOR X() REAL AND M = 2*N FOR COMPLEX.
